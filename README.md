# pyfront

Meteorish django responsive frontend

you first need to install:
- django 2.1
- django_channels
- channels_redis
- redis-server (up and running)

then juste run ./manage.py runserver from the root directory of this project

for now, it's juste possible ton insert from the commad line in the ./manage.py shell
just the time to add some button ;)
